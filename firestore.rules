/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all user-generated content,
 * ensuring that a user can only access their own data. Publicly accessible data, such as product
 * listings and categories, is read-only for all users to prevent unauthorized modification.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into top-level collections for public data (`products`, `categories`)
 * and a primary `users` collection. All private, user-specific data (shopping carts, orders, addresses)
 * is nested within a user's document under `/users/{userId}`, creating a clear and secure data boundary.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: All paths under `/users/{userId}` are strictly controlled, allowing access only to the
 *   authenticated user whose UID matches `{userId}`. Listing all users is explicitly disallowed.
 * - Public Data Read-Only: The `/products` and `/categories` collections are readable by anyone, including
 *   unauthenticated users, to support browsing the marketplace. However, all write operations are currently
 *   disabled pending the implementation of a specific administrative role system.
 * - Backend-Managed Orders: Users can read their own orders and order items, but cannot create, update, or
 *   delete them. This assumes that order creation is a trusted backend process (e.g., a Cloud Function)
 *   triggered after a successful payment, preventing clients from creating fraudulent orders.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The ruleset relies on path-based security. For documents within a user's
 * data tree (e.g., ShoppingCart, Order), rules validate that any internal `userAccountId` field matches the
 * `{userId}` in the path upon creation and remains immutable, ensuring relational integrity without costly lookups.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: Private user data (like `/users/{userId}/shoppingCarts`) is structurally separated
 * from public data (`/products`), which provides a simple and performant way to enforce different access levels
 * for read and list operations.
